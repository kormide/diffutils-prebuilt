This repository contains pre-built diffutils binaries based on the rust port [uutils/diffutils](https://github.com/uutils/diffutils) of the GNU [diffutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) project.

The binaries are statically compiled with a musl toolchain and don't depend on a version of libc at runtime.
